MinQL [Pronounced Min - cool] is a minimalistic query language based on the MySQL's Query Language. MinQL is achieved through python but, script for ruby also will be available shortly. The syntax goes as follows

SELECT QUERY
================

* <- table [compiles to  "SELECT * FROM table"]
* <- table | age > 25  [ Compiles to "SELECT * FROM table WHERE age>25"]

* <- table (field)  [ Compiles to "SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY (field)"]

* <- table [field]  [ Compiles to "SELECT * FROM table GROUP BY (field)"]
CREATE
==================

abc -> a:int,b:text [Compiles to CREATE TABLE abc (a int,b text)]

INSERT
==================

10,20,30 -> numbers [compiles to INSERT INTO numbers VALUES(10,20,30)]

UPDATE
==================

a=a+10 -> mytab | a>10 [compiles to UPDATE mytab SET a=a+10 where a>10]

DELETE
=====================

abc # [Compiles to DELETE FROM abc]
abc # a>10 [Compiles to DELETE FROM abc WHERE a>10]

MinQL also accepts variables.For Example :
&field <- users
prompts user for field
so,
&field <- &table
is a generic query, which is determined dynamically.
